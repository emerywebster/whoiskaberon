## About

Random project found on an old server that I thought I'd keep alive. Quick story:

- During college (2003-2007) I had a mix CD with "KABERON" written on it.
- One Saturday around 2009 I decided to make a little fan site for him...partly an experiment to see if he would find it (published at http://whoiskaberon.com)
- Within the next 6-8 months or so he did find it...and reached out to me via Facebook. 
- It turns out he was a high school friend of one of my college roommates...but somehow he still managed to find the site on his own.
- Neither of us became rich or famous (and sadly he hadn't made any new music either.

I wrote this before I knew anything about web development. Any new commits are only inteded to appease my OCD :grin:
